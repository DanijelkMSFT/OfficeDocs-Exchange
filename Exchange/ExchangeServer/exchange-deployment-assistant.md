# Exchange Deployment Assistant

The Exchange Deployment Assistant is a web-based tool that asks you a few questions about your current environment and then generates a custom step-by-step checklist that will help you deploy Exchange Server in your on-premises organization. The Deployment Assistant is currently available in English only.

Looking for help with migrating your Exchange organization to Microsoft 365, Office 365, or Exchange Online? Check out [Use the Microsoft 365 and Office 365 mail migration advisor](../ExchangeHybrid/mail-migration-jump.md).
